When running the project, select "Single Agent Movement" in the Main Menu to go to Assignment 1. 
Within that scene, there are different behaviors you can select from on the top right.
There is also a dropdown menu at the top left to change perspectives.

All C# scripts for this assignment can be found in "*.zip\Assets\HW 1 - Single Agent Movement". 
Behavior algorithms are in "Bot.cs", where you can find the code for all the required behaviors.
The following functions are used to implement these behaviors:
 - Dynamic Pursue & Arrive: Pursue()
 - Dynamic Evade: Evade()
 - Dynamic Wander: Wander()
 - Path Following: FollowPath()
