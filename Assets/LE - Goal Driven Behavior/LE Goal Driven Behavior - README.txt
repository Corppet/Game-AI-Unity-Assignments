When running the project, select "Hospital" in the Main Menu to go to the GOAP Tutorial Lecture Exercise. 
You may need to scroll down to find the option. Within that scene, you can watch the patients and nurses perform 
their respective behaviors.

All C# scripts for this exercise can be found in "*.zip\Assets\LE - Goal Driven Behavior\Scripts". 
Behavior algorithms are in the "GOAP" folder, while all actions are in the "Scripts" folder.

A goal and action was added to the patient where after being treated, they will wander to a corner of the 
hospital before leaving.

Note that the pathfinding algorithm is not perfect, so the agents may collide with one another and get stuck. 
If this occurs, resetting the scene is highly recommended.
