When running the project, select "Behaviour Trees" in the Main Menu to go to the Behaviour Trees Lecture Exercise. 
You may need to scroll down to find the option. Within that scene, you can adjust the balance of the agent. 
This is for a condition node in the behaviour tree that return FAILURE if the balance is more than 500 (thus the 
agent will not move).

All C# scripts for this exercise can be found in "*.zip\Assets\LE - Behaviour Trees\Scripts".
